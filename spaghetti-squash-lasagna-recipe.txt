Ingredients

Pepper
Salt
Olive Oil
1/2 cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese (plus extra for topping)
1/2 cup Ricotta or Cottage Cheese
1 cup Spinach (chopped)
1 cup Mushroom (chopped)
3 Cloves Garlic (chopped)
2 tbsp Fresh Basil
2 cup Pasta Sauce
1 lb Ground Turkey
1 Spaghetti Squash


Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Wash spaghetti squash and place in baking dish (9×13 works well) with a 1/2" of water.

Roast for 60 minutes. Cut in half lengthwise. Cut out and scoop out seeds and centre part. Discard. 

Using a fork, "shred" the pulp. Keep it in the shells to serve. It will look like very tiny spaghetti noodles.

While squash is roasting, brown the meat in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove turkey from the pan, drain and set aside. Cook garlic, mushrooms & spinach to wilt.

Add sauce to the pan and simmer. Add the meat back into the sauce.

In a bowl, combine the ricotta, mozzarella, and fresh basil.

Now we fill the squash shells. Start with a scoop of thered sauce, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture, (you can add extra mozzarella on each layer too!) and repeat the layers until you’ve over filled your squash, ending with a layer of red sauce and then topping them with mozzarella. Totally over fill them.

Turn the oven to broil and put them back in to brown up the chees top.
